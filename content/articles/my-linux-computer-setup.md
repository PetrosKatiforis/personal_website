## The Basics

I run Arch Linux on an old laptop with 6 GBs of RAM and a 250GB SSD. I've got a wireless logitech mouse and that's about it. Software wise, I use i3 as a tiling window manager. I use the default settings with [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) and pulse-audio for sound management.

### Programming Related

I use nvim for all of my projects. I've got a wide set of plugins that would take a considerable amount of time to list out here. You can find my vim configuration on [this dedicated github repository](https://github.com/PetrosKatiforis/NvimConfig)! For static site generation, including this site, I use [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), which is sort of like the rust version of Hugo.

### Special Applications

I use feh for image viewing and an old free version of aseprite for pixel art creation. Inkscape for creating SVG logos and anki for language learning and memorization. I've also installed newsboat which helps me track all of my RSS subscriptions.
