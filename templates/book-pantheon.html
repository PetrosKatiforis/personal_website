              I decided to include these books into a single entry, but I would definitely recommend 
              reading them both! They attempt to predict the possibly dystopian future of our planet.

              It's incredible and perhaps daunting how many of their concepts appear into our modern daily lives. 
              Pointless wars, soma (addicting substances/habits which make us ignore the world's real problems, 
              monitor our behavior/protesting and instead provide us with temporary and artificial pleasure as a 
              form of blindness (e.g. mobile phones, social media)), sacrifice of freedom for stability, 
              totalitarianism and public opinion control
